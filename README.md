# Dependency-Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental concept in Spring Framework, which promotes loose coupling and enhances testability and maintainability of applications. Below is an in-depth look at Dependency Injection in Spring, covering various aspects such as concepts, types, annotations, configuration, and practical examples.

1. Concepts
Dependency Injection: It's a design pattern that allows an object to receive other objects it depends on, rather than creating them internally. This externalizes the creation of dependencies, making the system more modular and easier to manage.

Inversion of Control (IoC): DI is a form of IoC where the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the application code to the Spring container.

2. Types of Dependency Injection
Spring supports three types of dependency injection:

Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
Setter Injection: Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
Field Injection: Dependencies are injected directly into the fields using annotations.
3. Annotations
Spring provides several annotations to facilitate DI:

@Autowired: Used for automatic dependency injection. It can be applied to constructors, fields, and setter methods.
@Inject: Part of JSR-330, similar to @Autowired.
@Resource: Part of JSR-250, used for dependency injection by name.
@Qualifier: Used in conjunction with @Autowired to specify which bean should be injected when multiple beans of the same type exist.
@Value: Used for injecting values from properties files

** Advantages of Dependency Injection**
Looser Coupling: Classes are less dependent on each other.
Enhanced Testability: Easier to mock dependencies for unit testing.
Easier Configuration Management: Centralized configuration of dependencies.
Improved Flexibility: Easy to switch implementations of dependencies.
